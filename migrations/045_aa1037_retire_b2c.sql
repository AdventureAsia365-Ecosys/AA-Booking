-- Migration bk-045: AA-1037 — retire the B2C half of AA-Booking (root ADR 0019, B2B-only model): drop the customer
-- tables and the customer invoice / payment tables (their rows archived first under the accounting exception), drop
-- trip_cases.customer_id, and limit new trip cases to b2b. The b2c trip cases and every row about them stay.
-- migrate: destructive
--
-- AA-1046 R4b part 1 (S271; draft and DRY RUN of AA-1037 S270, root docs/audits/2026-11-05-S270-aa1037-b2c-drop-dryrun/).
-- Merged as a migration-only PR (MIG-4, lesson 164) only after, in this order:
--   1. the readers outside Booking are gone: TripPlanner My Payments, the CIS data coverage row bk.customers, the CIS
--      KPI rows on these tables, the CIS erasure checklist line, the AA-CIS-Infra isolation probe cells on
--      booking.customers and booking.v_ops_inquiry_inbox and its owner-only exemption for booking.retired_b2c_record
--      (else runtime_grants.booking goes red on this apply), the Infra DM-6.5 consent script, the root contract
--      booking.customer.v1, the root DSAR runbook, consent query page and UAT scenarios BK-08 / BK-10 (all AA-1046
--      S271);
--   2. the Booking build that no longer reads or writes them is deployed (AA-1046 S271 code PR: the B2C routers and
--      services, app/inquiry/intake.py and its bk_inquiry_pull job, the staff admin pages; no trip_cases.customer_id);
--   3. a fresh DRY RUN (root docs/audits/2026-11-05-S270-aa1037-b2c-drop-dryrun/scripts/aa1037_b2c_dry_run.py) at
--      least 30 days after the last B2C write printed DRYRUN_PINS: it is pasted into `pins` below (every null
--      replaced) IN THIS PR, BEFORE it merges (a merged file is copied to AA-CIS-Infra and never edited again), and
--      the tech lead approved the drop with those numbers (destructive-ops.md step 4). With the nulls left in, the
--      apply on a database that still holds a B2C row refuses ("has no DRY RUN pin"): fail closed.
-- The `destructive` header makes DB Migrate take a manual RDS snapshot first and refuse to apply without it (MIG-12);
-- Migration Apply never auto-applies it (ADR 0017a). The snapshot is the rollback copy (aa:retain-until = apply + 180
-- days, id recorded in the dead-table registry); it is NOT the retention copy of anything (see "Data rules").
--
-- Owner: AA-Booking (key bk-045). Runs as bk_owner (live owner of schema booking since bk-014).
--
-- Data rules (DM-7.1 retention table, DM-6.7, DM-7.3 of root docs/architecture/data-standards/02-data-management.md):
--   * Rows under the accounting exception (DM-7.1: invoices, invoice_items, payment_schedule, payments, supplier
--     bills / bill lines / payouts, ops_files of kinds payment_evidence / supplier_bill / payout_evidence and their S3
--     objects) are never deleted here. The four customer money tables are copied row for row (to_jsonb, every column)
--     into the new append-only table booking.retired_b2c_record, with retain_until = 31 December of (year of the
--     row's last write, Vietnam time) + 10, and the copy is checked equal before the tables drop. The supplier money
--     rows and every ops_files row stay where they are, untouched. booking.retired_b2c_record has its own DM-7.1 row
--     (root PR of AA-1037 S270); DM-7.3's S3 Parquet archive does not exist yet (N4), so the archive is in the
--     database, owner-only, and moves to S3 with the other accounting rows when N4 lands.
--   * booking.audit_logs ("kept (append-only)"), booking.trip_case_status_history ("kept (audit evidence)"),
--     booking.notifications and booking.inbox_events rows (proposed / payload-only windows: nothing deleted until
--     approved) are not touched: no b2c trip case, version, supplier booking, check or status row is deleted, so
--     nothing cascades. Their CHECKs keep the 'customer' / 'payment' values the kept rows use.
--   * Dropped without an archive: booking.customers, customer_identities (follows its customer), customer_otps and
--     customer_sessions (credentials; DM-7.1 already plans to drop both tables), media_files (customer profile
--     pictures; 0 inserts on Dev). These are the personal master and credentials of a retired channel with no
--     remaining purpose (ADR 0019); the accounting copy of the person (the invoice bill_to snapshot) is archived above.
--
-- What, in this order (one transaction):
--   0. Guards (RAISE, nothing changes): running as bk_owner; no inquiry intake job (bk_inquiry_pull /
--      bk_inquiry_process) queued or running; NO B2C ROW WRITTEN IN THE LAST 30 DAYS (the block between
--      "last-write:begin" and "last-write:end", byte-equal to the DRY RUN's LAST_WRITE_SQL: customers, identities,
--      OTPs (created / used), sessions, media, the four invoice tables, b2c trip cases and their versions, supplier
--      bookings / bills / bill lines / payouts of b2c cases, their operations files (created / updated / removed),
--      inquiry inbox rows); every dropped table still holds exactly the rows the DRY RUN pinned (row count AND an md5
--      over the non-personal columns of every row: key, write times, codes; an app UPDATE moves a write time and a
--      delete-plus-insert moves the id, so either after the DRY RUN also refuses; checked only when a
--      dropped table has a row: an empty schema, as in the Integration Tests' replay, loses nothing); no view or
--      foreign key outside this file depends on a dropped object.
--   1. Archive: booking.retired_b2c_record, then the four customer money tables copied into it and checked.
--   2. Views rewritten without B2C (same columns, grants kept): v_trip_check_board (payment_verified is NULL on every
--      case: no customer invoice any more), v_ops_data_totals (the 'customers' metric goes; CIS data coverage stops
--      reading it first).
--   3. Functions rewritten without B2C: trip_cases_post_sale_guard (every money status refused, as for b2b before),
--      ops_files_guard (no new customer payment evidence; the kept one can no longer change).
--   4. Drop the B2C views, then the invoice / payment tables (their triggers and guard functions go with them).
--   5. trip_cases: drop customer_id; trip_cases_channel_chk lets only b2b cases in from now on (the kept b2c cases,
--      created before the apply, still pass it).
--   6. Drop the customer tables, media_files and the B2C sequences.
--   7. Config: the invoice ops_transitions edges and the money edges of a trip case go (reference data, DM-7.1).
--   8. Register bk-045.
--
-- Kept on purpose: the b2c trip cases and everything about them (see "Data rules"); booking.inbox_events and
-- inbox_cursor (the CIS catalog lifecycle feed, source 'cis', uses them; the inquiry rows stay under DM-6.6),
-- invoice_sequence (AAS / AAT agency invoice numbers), the settings rows (payment_instructions is read by agency
-- billing; the B2C-only keys deposit_due_days, balance_due_days_before_start, payment_due_soon_days,
-- payment_overdue_reminder_days and invoice_issuer are left for a later cleanup with their code), the trip case
-- statuses invoice_sent / payment_pending / paid in trip_cases_status_chk (kept b2c cases may hold them; unreachable
-- once the edges are gone).
-- Outside this file: the S3 objects of media_files rows (if any; 0 on Dev) are purged after the apply. The ops-docs
-- objects of ops_files rows stay (their rows stay). TripPlanner's own customer tables are a TripPlanner migration.
--
-- Locks: SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE on the nine dropped tables and trip_cases from the first statement (no write lands
-- between the guards and the drops), then ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on every dropped table and view and on trip_cases (DROP
-- COLUMN, constraint swap) for the length of the transaction. Apply while the job tables are idle (DB Migrate waits for that) and Booking traffic is
-- low; lock_timeout 5s, retry on a timeout.
-- Undo: none in SQL. Restore from the pre-apply snapshot (db-migrate-bk-045-<run>-<attempt>); the archived money
-- rows can also be read back from booking.retired_b2c_record.record.
-- Re-runnable: every step reads to_regclass / IF EXISTS; after a full apply the guards find nothing and the file
-- only re-registers (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING).
